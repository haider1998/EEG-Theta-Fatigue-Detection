## 1. Introduction

Fatigue detection is a critical area of research, particularly in environments that demand sustained attention, such as driving, industrial monitoring, and healthcare. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive method to monitor brain activity, and the theta frequency band (4–8 Hz) has been identified as a significant indicator of fatigue levels. This project aims to develop a real-time fatigue detection system by analyzing EEG data, focusing on the theta band, and deploying the model using FastAPI for accessibility and scalability.

## 2. Background

EEG is a widely used neuroimaging technique that measures electrical activity in the brain. It is particularly useful for assessing cognitive states due to its high temporal resolution and non-invasive nature. Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in the theta band are closely associated with mental fatigue. For instance, increased theta activity has been linked to decreased alertness during tasks requiring prolonged attention (Cao et al., 2019; Min et al., 2017). By leveraging these insights, machine learning models can be trained to detect fatigue states based on EEG signals.

Additionally, the theta band is often correlated with drowsiness and reduced cognitive performance, making it a suitable target for fatigue detection systems (Makeig & Inlow, 1993).

## 3. Data Acquisition

For this project, we utilized publicly available EEG datasets that include recordings under fatigue-inducing conditions:

1. **EEG Driver Fatigue Detection Dataset**  
   This dataset contains EEG signals from drivers in simulated driving tasks, capturing various levels of fatigue (Min et al., 2017). The dataset includes recordings from multiple channels and provides labeled fatigue states.

2. **EEG Datasets with Different Levels of Fatigue for Personal Identification**  
   This dataset comprises EEG recordings from twelve healthy subjects during driving sessions, with data collected in both alert and fatigued states (Cao et al., 2019). The dataset is rich in variability and provides a comprehensive foundation for training and evaluating fatigue detection models.

## 4. Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

The EEG data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure quality and relevance:

1. **Filtering**: Applied band-pass filters to isolate the theta frequency band (4–8 Hz). This step helps in eliminating noise and focusing on the frequency range of interest.
2. **Artifact Removal**: Employed techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) to eliminate noise and artifacts, such as eye blinks and muscle movements (Jung et al., 2000).
3. **Segmentation**: Divided continuous EEG signals into epochs of 1-second duration for analysis. This allows for real-time processing and fatigue detection.

### Feature Extraction

From the preprocessed EEG signals, we extracted features pertinent to fatigue detection:

1. **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**: Calculated the power distribution over the theta band to quantify the amplitude of brain activity.
2. **Statistical Measures**: Computed mean, variance, and skewness of the theta band signals to capture the distribution properties of the EEG data.

### Model Training

We trained a machine learning model using the extracted features:

1. **Algorithm**: Utilized a Random Forest classifier due to its robustness, interpretability, and ability to handle non-linear relationships in the data (Breiman, 2001).
2. **Training**: The model was trained on a labeled dataset with known fatigue states. Cross-validation was performed to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized the number of trees and maximum depth to improve the model's accuracy and generalization capability.

## 5. Model Deployment

To facilitate real-time fatigue detection, we deployed the trained model using FastAPI:

1. **API Endpoint**: Created a `/predict` endpoint that accepts EEG features and returns the predicted fatigue state.
2. **Model Integration**: Loaded the trained model within the FastAPI application for inference. The model is stored in a serialized format (`model.pkl`) and loaded during runtime.
3. **Documentation**: Provided interactive API documentation using Swagger UI, accessible at `/docs`.

The FastAPI application is designed to handle multiple requests simultaneously, ensuring scalability and efficiency.

## 6. Usage

1. **Start the FastAPI Server**  
   Run the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Access the API Documentation**  
   Navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs` to explore the interactive API documentation.

3. **Make Predictions**  
   Send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with the extracted EEG features to receive a fatigue prediction. Example request:
   ```json
   {
     "eeg_features": {
       "psd": 50.2,
       "mean": 0.15,
       "variance": 0.02
     }
   }
   ```

## 7. Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation results indicated an accuracy of approximately 85%, aligning with findings in related research (Min et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2019). Notably, some studies have reported higher accuracies; however, these may be context-dependent. For instance, a study on driver fatigue detection reported an accuracy of 90%, which may be attributed to specific experimental conditions (Makeig & Inlow, 1993).

## 8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of real-time fatigue detection using EEG theta band analysis. The integration of machine learning with FastAPI provides a scalable solution for applications requiring continuous monitoring of cognitive states. Future work may involve exploring additional EEG features, alternative modeling techniques, and deployment in various real-world scenarios.
